I am a first-year CS M.S. student at Brown University. My research interest is broadly in 3D computer vision and graphics. 

Previously, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Tufts University. During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to work with Prof. Liping Liu on graph neural networks and Prof. Michael Hughes on generalized category discovery. I also had the opportunity to intern at Watcher Asset, Redwall-taihe Fund Management, and Fidelity Investments.
