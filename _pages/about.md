I am a first-year PhD student at Purdue University, advised by Prof. Daniel Aliaga. My research interests are computer graphics, 3D computer vision, and deep learning.

Previously, I earned my Master's degree from Brown University, where I had the privilege of working with Prof. Daniel Ritchie and Prof. Srinath Sridhar on procedural modeling and 3D generative models. I received my bachelor’s degree from Tufts University, with three majors in computer science, applied mathematics, and economics. During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to work with Prof. Michael Hughes on generalized category discovery and Prof. Liping Liu on graph neural networks.

## Implementations
Every now and then, we come across papers without code. Here is a record of codeless papers I implemented for personal interest / research needs. Hopefully you can notice how my coding skills grow over time from these repos:) 

1.  **On Distillation of Guided Diffusion Models** [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03142) [[code]](https://github.com/ruiqixu37/distill_diffusion)
2.  **Nuvo: Neural UV Mapping for Unruly 3D Representations** [[paper]](https://pratulsrinivasan.github.io/nuvo/) [[code]](https://github.com/ruiqixu37/Nuvo)
