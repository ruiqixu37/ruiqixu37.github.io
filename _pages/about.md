I am a final-year Masters student at Brown University. My research interests are computer graphics, 3D computer vision, and deep learning. In particular, I aspire to **make 3D generative models controllable, interpretable, and powerful**. I am currently doing research with Brown Visual Computing group, co-supervised by Prof. Daniel Ritchie and Prof. Srinath Sridhar. 

Previously, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Tufts University. During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to work with Prof. Michael Hughes on generalized category discovery and Prof. Liping Liu on graph neural networks. I also had the opportunity to intern at Redwall-taihe Fund Management, Fidelity Investments, Platinum AI, and Foundation LLM.

  I worked on this project during my internship at Platinum AI, while I was taking a year off from undergraduate. TLDR: We propose a method to specialize small language models towards text style transfer tasks by training a latent attribute predictor (based on small T5 models) via contrastive learning.

## Implementations
Every now and then, we come across papers without code. Here is a record of codeless papers I implemented for personal interest / research needs. Hopefully you can notice how my coding skills grow over time from these repos:) 

1.  **On Distillation of Guided Diffusion Models (41 stars)** [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03142) [[code]](https://github.com/ruiqixu37/distill_diffusion)
