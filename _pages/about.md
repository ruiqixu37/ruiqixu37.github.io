I am a first-year masters student at Brown University. My research interest is broadly in computer graphics and 3D generative/reconstruction models. I am working as a researcher assistant in Brown Visual Computing group, co-supervised by Prof. Daniel Ritchie and Prof. Srinath Sridhar. 

Previously, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Tufts University. During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to work with Prof. Michael Hughes on generalized category discovery and Prof. Liping Liu on graph neural networks. I also had the opportunity to intern at Watcher Asset, Redwall-taihe Fund Management, Fidelity Investments, and Platinum AI.

## Implementations
Every now and then, we come across papers without code. Here is a record of codeless papers I implemented for personal interest / research needs. From these repos, you can probably notice how my coding skills grow over time and how much ChatGPT I used :)
